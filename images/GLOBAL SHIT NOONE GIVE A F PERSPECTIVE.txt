Slide 4-Introduction


Substance abuse, also known as drug abuse, is defined by the excessive and harmful use of drugs. It includes the use of drugs in quantities or ways that endanger the individual's well-being and may have an impact on those around them. Substance abuse is classified as a type of substance-related disorder and is defined differently in the public health, medical, and criminal justice domains.  It is important to note that drug use can lead to criminal or anti-social behaviour, and long-term substance abuse can result in permanent personality changes. Individuals who abuse drugs may face legal consequences in addition to physical, social, and psychological harm.

Slide 5-Impact Of Substance Abuse 


It is a disease that affects a person's brain and behaviour, resulting in an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine.  Substances such as alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine are also classified as drugs. When you are addicted, you may continue to use the drug despite the harm it causes. Drug addiction can begin with the experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent.Substance use disorders (SUDs) are associated with a wide range of medical, psychiatric, psychological, spiritual, economic, social, family, and legal issues, posing a significant burden on affected individuals, their families, and society. 

Slide 6-Causes Of Substance Abuse

Although genetics are thought to be responsible for 40% to 60% of a person's risk, the exact cause of substance use disorders is still unknown.  In early adolescence or childhood, substance use frequently gets its start as a way to feel good or out of curiosity.Increased tolerance brought on by frequent use of the substance opens the door to addiction and substance use disorders. With a co-occurring mental illness like depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder, some adults who develop substance use disorders start abusing drugs or alcohol to treat their symptoms.
dditional risk factors that could result in a substance use disorder are as follows:

Family history of addiction
Sleep problems
Chronic pain
Financial difficulties
Divorce or the loss of a loved one 
Long-term tobacco habit
Tense home environment 
Lack of parental attachment in childhood 
Relationship issues 

Slide 7-Substance Abuse Among Teenagers

Teenage years can be a time when irrational, impulsive decisions are made. Living in the moment without taking into account potential consequences is possible at this time.Before one even enters high school, the average age of substance use initiation is between 13 and 14 years old, in the seventh and eighth grades. Teenage substance abuse is influenced by a number of factors, including peer pressure, curiosity, and a lack of knowledge about the potential repercussions.

Slide 9-Consequences Of Substance Abuse

Youth who abuse substances repeatedly frequently struggle in a variety of ways, including in school, with their physical and mental health, with their peer relationships, and with involvement in the juvenile justice system.The effects of substance abuse are extensive, affecting academic performance, physical health, and mental health. It causes adolescents' grades to drop, school absences to rise, and dropout rates to rise. It also presents risks to physical health, such as overdoses, illnesses, and accidents. Additionally, substance abuse has a big impact on mental health, causing withdrawal, depression, developmental delays, and a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and actions.

Slide 10-Courses Of Action

(1)Before speaking with your teen, make a plan of action to ensure readiness and a conversational goal.(2)Discuss the risks of drug use with your teen, expressing your concerns and giving concrete examples.(3) Increase the amount of time you spend with your teen, be aware of their whereabouts, and inquire about their activities. Encourage honesty and open communication with your teen.(4)If you think someone may be abusing drugs, get professional help from doctors or counselors.

Slide 11-Perspective

Slide 12- Global Perspective

Data on drug use and its consequences has grown dramatically over the last 20 years.From a global perspective, the evidence reviewed from the various regions indicates that the use of drugs with liability for abuse is widespread and associated with public health and social problems of great magnitude.

Slide 13-National Persspective

Following initial discussions with legislators, the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control established and ran a comprehensive consultation process involving government, non-government, academic, and civil society stakeholders. The new policy incorporates health and social policy responses, outlining a path to promoting sustainable alternative development for opium farmers, refocusing law enforcement and justice efforts to address organised crime, and expanding regional and international cooperation.
